
ðŸŽ¯ Proposed Transformation Plan
Entity Mapping (Minimal Backend Changes)
Projects â†’ Hackathons

Keep same structure, just rename terminology
themeId becomes categoryId (Web Dev, AI/ML, Blockchain, etc.)
Episodes â†’ Teams

Each hackathon has multiple participating teams
Add fields: teamSize, teamLeader, registrationStatus
Perfect fit - maintains same parent-child relationship
Scripts â†’ Submissions

Each team creates project submissions (code, docs, presentations)
Keep authorId (team leader), content (project description)
Repurpose language field â†’ submissionType (code/documentation/presentation)
status field perfect for (Draft/Submitted/UnderReview/Evaluated)
Radio Stations â†’ Colleges/Venues

Organizations/colleges hosting or participating
Keep same access control structure for hackathon access
Themes â†’ Categories/Tracks

Hackathon categories (Web Dev, AI/ML, Mobile, etc.)
User Roles Transformation
Current	New	Permissions
Admin	Organizer	Full access - create hackathons, manage teams, view all submissions, download all files
Editor	Analyzer/Judge	View & download all submissions, evaluate teams, cannot create hackathons
Member/Contributor	Participant	Upload files ONCE (no edit/delete after upload), view own team's submissions
Critical Permission Changes Needed
For Participants (most important change):

canUpload: true (unlike current members)
canEdit: false AFTER initial upload (new logic needed)
canDelete: false (enforce submission finality)
Can only access their own team's files
For Organizers & Analyzers:

Keep full download/view access across all teams
Organizers can edit/delete, Analyzers view-only on submissions
UI Terminology Changes (Quick Find & Replace)
"Projects" â†’ "Hackathons"
"Episodes" â†’ "Teams"
"Scripts" â†’ "Submissions"
"Radio Stations" â†’ "Colleges/Venues"
"Create New Project" â†’ "Create New Hackathon"
"Episode Files" â†’ "Team Files"
"Script Editor" â†’ "Submission Portal"
Minimal New Features Needed
Upload Lock System: Add uploadedAt timestamp - once set, participants can't edit that file
Team Dashboard: Rename episode dashboard showing team members and their submission status
Evaluation System: Repurpose script review comments for judge evaluations
Submission Deadline: Add deadline field to hackathons (teams can't upload after deadline)
What Stays Exactly the Same âœ…
File upload/download infrastructure
Analytics & tracking system
Notification system
Folder organization
Authentication flow
Database structure (just rename tables/columns)
Multi-file support per entity
Implementation Strategy (Without Building from Scratch)
Phase 1: Schema & Types (1 rename, backend stays same)

Rename tables in SQL (ALTER TABLE)
Update TypeScript types in schema.ts
Update role names in permissions
